![Eye Care Timer Demo](https://demo.rexadev.ir/assets/eye-care-timer.png)

## Introduction 

### The "20-20-20" Rule:
Every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet away, for at least 20 seconds.
### What's The Problem?
We cannot set the timer for every 20 minutes. We have to set the timer 3 times in 1 hour and 72 times a day! It's boring.
### What's The Solution?
In "Eye Care Timer" you can just press the start button and every 20 minutes you will be notified by a push notification, then it will wait for 20 seconds and continue to work for the next 20 minutes.

## Setup
```
npm run dev
```

## Todo
- [ ] Electron Version
