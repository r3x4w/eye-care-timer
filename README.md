### The "20-20-20" Rule
Every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet away, for at least 20 seconds.
### What's The Problem?
We can't keep setting the timer every 20 minutes. We have to set the timer three times in one hour and 72 times a day! This is tedious.

### What's The Solution?
In "Eye Care Timer," you can just press the start button, and every 20 minutes, you will be notified. Then, it will wait for 20 seconds and continue to work for the next 20 minutes.

## Setup
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
